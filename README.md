# AC-Light-Dimmer-Module-with-ZC-Detector
This compact AC light dimmer module uses a triac and zero-crossing detector for precise, flicker-free control of incandescent lamps and fans via microcontrollers. It ensures safety with optoisolation and handles inductive loads with a snubber circuit. Ideal for lighting and speed control, itâ€™s flexible and easy to integrate.
